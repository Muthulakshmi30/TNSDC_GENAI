Problem Statement
Domain Shift: Unpaired image translation often involves domains with significant differences in visual appearance, such as day to night conversion or photo to painting transformation. Domain shift refers to the misalignment between the distributions of source and target domains, leading to poor translation quality and artifacts in the generated images.

Mode Collapse: CycleGANs are prone to mode collapse, where the generator fails to capture the entire distribution of the target domain, resulting in limited diversity and repetitive patterns in the generated images. Mode collapse reduces the richness and realism of the translated images, undermining the quality of the translation.

Semantic Ambiguity: In unpaired image translation, preserving semantic content while changing visual attributes is crucial for maintaining the integrity and meaning of the images. However, existing methods struggle to disentangle content from style, leading to semantic ambiguity and distortion in the translated images
